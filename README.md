# codeRefactor
homework1

A marketing webpage that includes search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.

For this webpage, I made the code neater and more condensed. There was lots of redundancy in the original code, and was not necessary. 
When you click each of the options on the top right, it will take you down the page to where the description is located. On the right side of the page, we have our benefits, and at the very bottom we have our copyright and the creator of the page. 

The images should be placed in the correct sections, and sections should be floating evenly.
